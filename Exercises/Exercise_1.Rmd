ORLA 6541 - Exercise 1 

Wickham & Grolemund (2017): Chapters 3 through 6
Bulut & Dejardins (2019): Chapter 4

```{r libaries}
library(tidyverse) 
library(nycflights13) # used in Wickham Chapter 3 
```

# Chapter 3 
## Data Transformations with dplyr 


```{r}
# explore data set
head(mtcars) 
```

## 3.2.4 Exercises
### Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?
We see an empty graph because we have not specified any additional layers in our code. For example, we have not told R to return a specific type of plot, like a dot plot, nor have we provided variables to visualize some relationship within the data. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) 
```


How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?



What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.

Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.

What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?
